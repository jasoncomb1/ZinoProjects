        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <div class="challenge">
            <h3>1. Load Handling</h3>
            <p>
                One of the main challenges we faced was determining how the circuit would handle varying loads. Different devices have different power requirements, and ensuring the circuit could adapt to these without causing issues was a significant concern.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge">
            <h3>2. Overheating</h3>
            <p>
                As we tested the circuit with different loads, we encountered issues related to overheating. It was crucial to find a balance between circuit performance and preventing components from becoming too hot, which could pose safety risks.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>How We Overcame Challenges</h2>
        <div class="solution">
            <h3>1. Load Handling</h3>
            <p>
                To address the load handling challenge, we conducted an extensive research on power distribution and reconnected diffrent wires to be able to distribute current accordingly based on the connected devices. This involved the use of specialized components and careful calibration.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="solution">
            <h3>2. Overheating</h3>
            <p>
                To tackle the overheating issue, we redesigned the circuit layout, optimized component placement, and we changed the wires to a much stronger one for free flow of current to over come the issue.
